\chapter{Document history}
\label{ch:history}

\asdl{} and \asdlgen{} (originally named \texttt{asdlGen}) were developed as part
of the National Compiler Infrastructure Project at Princeton University in the
late 1990's~\cite{usenix:zephyr-asdl}.
The original version of this manual was written by Dan Wang as part of that project.
As part of reimplementing and modernizing \asdl{}, John Reppy converted this manual
to \LaTeX{} and did some light editing.
The original implementation of \texttt{asdlGen} and of this manual can be
found at \url{http://asdl.sourceforge.net}.

Here is a history of changes to \asdl{}, \asdlgen{}, and this manual.
The changes are indexed by SML/NJ release numbers.
